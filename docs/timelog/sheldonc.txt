Before Spring Break:
- Drafted the gantt chart
- Drafted the proposed design document contents
- Completed most of the design document
- Completed an ER diagram and relational schema for our database
- Completed an early draft of our front end HTML/CSS

Week Before Spring Break:
- I left early for a trip, so I put extra time in between 3/11 and 3/13 and did not touch schoolwork afterwards
    - During that time I completed most of the design document
    - The design document, DB models, and front end work took significant time - probably 8-10ish hours
