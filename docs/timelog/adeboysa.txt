# Pre-Spring Break Work 
- 20250309, 90, Researched RFID hardware options
- 20250313, 90, Met with team to discuss next steps
- 20250313, 60, Finalized design document sections

# Post-Spring Break Work
- 20250315, 30, Created docs/planning/20250315 directory and uploaded updated GANTT chart (hardware setup 100% complete) 
- 20250324, 30, Updated GANTT chart to reflect hardware delays 
- 20250326, 20, Updated timelog directory to be a single textfile (moved old entries to adeboysa.txt)
- 20250327, 30, Had a team meeting to discuss hardware delays, updated Gantt chart to reflect completions 
- 20250328, 30, Our group met with Ashley to get hardware that was purchased(RFID Scanner, Pi 4, POE, and power supply). We will get the rest of the  hardware by next week. I also borrowed a Pi from COSI so I could play around with a few things. 
- 20250403, 60, Group meeting to discuss RAPS tasks and the need for a micro HDMI. Gave the remaining RFID scanners to Hunter for soldering. Worked on slides. Later that day, I got a breadboard from a friend to see if I could connect the RFID scanner to the PI.
- 20250404, 10, Picked up wires for connecting RFID Scanner to PI with breadboard. 
- 20250405, 15, I still had one RFID Scanner with me, so I attempted to connect the RFID scanner to Pi but realized that it didn't work because the header pins had to be soldered(still learning more about this). Will also need a micro HDMI for personal use to connect to Pi. 
- 20250410
20250410, 60, Met with team to troubleshoot HDMI/display issues on the Pi
20250410, 10, Gave HDMI cables and wires to Ron for testing display output
20250410, 15, Confirmed HDMI cables worked; issue traced to faulty SD card, so Hunter switched to his own
20250410, 15, Received soldered RFID scanner from Hunter and no longer need breadboard
20250410, 30, Connected RFID scanner to Pi; unsure if working due to no red light indicator
20250410, 60, Flashed Raspberry Pi OS to USB and explored Raspberry Pi ecosystem (personal learning goal)
- 20250411
20250411, 30, Missed RAPS due to another class presentation but attended awards ceremony after team received top scorer in category
20250411, 05, Updated GANTT chart to reflect RAPS milestone completion
- 20250414
20250414, 15, Reconfigured RFID-to-Pi wiring to verify pin alignment
20250414, 30, Wrote basic Python script (Write.py) to test RFID scanner behavior
20250414, 30, Created Read.py to test card detection and data output
20250414, 15, Confirmed RFID functionality through terminal reads (no red LED visible but scanner works)
