1) if you offered to meet with your user to give them a demo/presentation in addition to the April 22 presentations in class? How did they respond?
We did not do that as the demo we had was not working with the RFID scanner yet as there were some delays.

2) if you did actually meet with your user to give them a demo/presentation in addition to the April 22 presentations in class? 
Did not meet as there was no time due to finals and other stuff. We have a detailed maintenance plan and updated design document with final UI as we cannot provide a live demo

3) Have they given you any feedback directly?
No
