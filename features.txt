Reamining features to implement
- Automatically detect when a student forgets to sign out and do it for them automatically at midnight
- Page that allows admin to:
    - select what data they want exported as a csv
    - make modifications to the db, such as adding a machine
- csv import feature that takes an admin's csv and uses it to modify the db

Other potential issues:
- Student id & username are unique, which will cause an error if a duplicate is entered
