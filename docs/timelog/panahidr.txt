Met with team to discuss current stage of the project. Discussed how to fix minimal problems with HTML files, how to use the hardware
that we have received, and how to proceed with our RAPS presentation. I created the RAPS slide and began updating them with information
about our project, including both software and hardware.

I continued updating the RAPS slides with information about our project and focused on properly formatting the slides as well. 
I also made some tweaks to the HTML files by fixing the Returning Student screen to display the correct stations at the Makerspace. I also
changed some of the wording on the screens to be more accurate.
